## General Information
- To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.


## ProjectPipeline
- Data Reading/Data Understanding → Defining the path for train and test images 
- Dataset Creation→ Create train & validation dataset from the train directory with a batch size of 32. Also, make sure you resize your images to 180*180.
- Dataset visualisation → Create a code to visualize one instance of all the nine classes present in the dataset 
- Model Building & training
- Chose an appropriate data augmentation strategy to resolve underfitting/overfitting 
- Model Building & training on the augmented data
- Class distribution: Examine the current class distribution in the training dataset
- Handling class imbalances: Rectify class imbalances present in the training dataset with Augmentor library.
- Model Building & training on the rectified class imbalance data




## Technologies Used
- Pandas     - version 1.4.4
- Numpy      - version 1.21.5
- Matplotlib - version 3.5.2
- tensorflow
